            <para>Installing eXist-db on your computer is quick and easy. Once you confirm that your
                system meets the requirements, download the installer, follow the installation
                instructions, and before long you'll be up and running with eXist-db.</para>

            <title>System Requirements</title>
            <para>eXist-db is compatible with all recent versions of Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.
                Out of the box, eXist-db uses 512 MB of RAM and about 200 MB of disk space.
                Administrative privileges are not required to install or run eXist-db, but certain
                installation procedures are not possible without administrative privileges. The
                critical requirement is that Java be installed.</para>
            <note id="about-java">
                <title>eXist-db and Java</title>
                <para>eXist-db is built on Java, a free, cross-platform software development
                    environment that comes in a number of versions. The version that eXist-db
                    requires is Java 6, released by Oracle. Other versions, including Java 7 and
                    OpenJDK have not been tested, so they are not yet supported. Both the "JRE"
                    (Java Runtime Environment) and "JDK" (Java Development Kit) versions are
                    acceptable for eXist-db, as long as you use version 6. For instructions about
                    running Java on your operating system, see Oracle's <ulink

            <para>Download the installer for the latest stable release of eXist-db from the <ulink

                    <filename>eXist-setup-[version]-revXXXXX.jar</filename>. Here, [version] and
                XXXXX reflect the version of eXist-db, and .jar is a Java Archive file. Again, we
                recomend that you download the <emphasis>latest stable release</emphasis>.</para>

                <title>Versions of eXist-db</title>
                <para>eXist-db has advanced rapidly in recent years, and we recommend you use the
                    most recent version. These instructions do assume you are using the most recent
                    version for the best experience and performance, so if you are not using the
                    most recent stable version of eXist-db, see our article on <ulink

            </note>
	    <!-- NB: I think we need to rephrase no graphical installer for
		 GNU/Linux since its only the launching of the installer we are 
		 talking about. /ljo -->
            <para>Once the download has completed, launch the eXist-db installer. To launch the
                installer on Mac or Windows, simply double-click the .jar you downloaded file. (On
                Mac OS X 10.7 and higher, a security feature called <ulink
                    url="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290">Gatekeeper</ulink> may prevent the
                installer from running since eXist-db is not registered with Apple; to circumvent
                the warning dialog and allow the installer to run, right-click or control-click the
                file and select Open.) On Linux, there is no graphical installer, so you must use
                the command line to enter the following command:
                <synopsis format="linespecific">java -jar eXist-setup-[version]-revXXXXX.jar</synopsis>
                (Windows and Mac users can also use the command line procedure, but most users
                prefer the graphical installer.)</para>
            <para>After the installer is launched, follow the prompts described below to complete
                the installation. We recommend that you accept the default options, since these are
                designed to make using eXist-db easy. The installer's dialog panes are as follows: <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>(Windows only) <emphasis>Select the Path to Java</emphasis>: You will
                            be asked to select where Java is located on your computer. Browse to
                            C:\Program Files\Java, and then select your most up to date version of
                            Java. Click Next.</para>

                            asked where to install eXist-db on your hard disk. The installer will
                            suggest an appropriate directory, but if you want, you can install
                            eXist-db anywhere on your system.</para>

                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis>Choose the Data Directory</emphasis>: The data directory is
                            where eXist-db keeps its data files. The installer will suggest keeping
                            the data files inside the application directory, but you can select a
                            different location if you want.</para>

                    <listitem>
                        <para><emphasis>Choose the Admin Password</emphasis>: The Admin Password is
                            a password for the eXist-db administrator account, or more commonly, the
                            "admin" account. This admin account belongs to you, and certain key
                            functions in eXist-db can only be performed by the admin. While you can
                            leave the admin password blank, we strongly recommend setting the
                            password in order to secure access your installation of eXist-db. Why?
                            Keep in mind that while eXist-db is running, it can be accessed by other
                            users on your local network (be it in your home or office, or at a cafe
                            or on a train). So, securing your administrator's account on eXist-db is
                            a good way to protect your data and prevent others from abusing the
                            account. Best to choose a unique password.</para>

                            are optional. Removing "sources" and "javadoc" cuts the installation
                            size in half, but best to install everything unless you are starved for
