            <para>Installing eXist-db on your computer should be quick and easy. First, confirm that your
                system meets the requirements. Next, download the installer and follow the
                installation instructions here. Before you know it you'll be up and running with
                eXist-db.</para>

            <para>eXist-db is compatible with all recent versions of Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.
                Out of the box, eXist-db requires at least 512 MB of RAM and about 200 MB of disk
                space. Administrative privileges are not required to install or run eXist-db, but
                certain installation procedures are not possible without administrative privileges.
                The critical requirement is that Java be installed.</para>

                <title>eXist-db and Java</title>
                <para>eXist-db is built on Java, a free, cross-platform software development
                    environment. Java comes in a number of versions, so it is important that you
                    install the version that eXist-db requires: Java 8 (since eXistdb 3.0). eXist-db can run with
                    both the Java "JRE" (Java Runtime Environment) and the "JDK" (Java Development
                    Kit). The JRE is adequate for running eXist-db; you do not need the JDK unless
                    you intend to compile eXist-db from its source code. For instructions about
                    running Java on your operating system, see Oracle's <ulink url="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/index_installing.xml">Installing
                        Java</ulink> page.</para>
                <para><emph>Warning:</emph> If you have installed Saxon as a JRE extension (via the extensions folder), this can cause a critical error during installation. To avoid this error user need to either
                    remove the JRE extension, or install a second JRE which you use just for eXist-db and set the JAVA_HOME to that when running eXist-db.</para>
                <para>Linux users: Unfortunately, Oracle's own pages (such as the link above) focus
                    on commercial Linux distributions. Users of other distributions are better
                    served by distribution-specific instructions. Instructions that eXist-db users
                    have found useful include: <ulink url="http://livingtao.blogspot.com/2012/01/few-easy-steps-to-install-sunoracle-jdk.html">Amazon Linux</ulink>, <ulink url="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html">Ubuntu</ulink> and <ulink url="http://www.webupd8.org/2012/06/how-to-install-oracle-java-7-in-debian.html">Debian</ulink>.</para>                
                <para>Special note: In general it recommended to use the Oracle Java VM, this is the safest choice. The OpenJDK 7 is a good open source alternative for the Oracle JVM.</para>
                <para>Details of the Java VM can be obtained via the following command (two results displayed):
                    <synopsis format="java">java -version
java version ""1.8.0_60-ea""
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-ea-b19)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b19, mixed mode)
</synopsis>
                </para>
                <para>Note for For pre eXist-db v2.2 versions: Due to reported compatibility issues it is NOT recommended to use "OpenJDK6" (IcedTea) and "GNU Compiler for Java" (GCJ) which are shipped by several Linux distributions.</para>

            <title>Installing eXist-db</title>
            <para>Download the installer for the latest stable release of eXist-db from the <ulink url="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html#subscriptions">Downloads</ulink> page. The installer is a single file called
                <filename>eXist-setup-[version]-revXXXXX.jar</filename>. Here, [version] and
                XXXXX reflect the version and revision numbers of eXist-db, and .jar is a Java
                Archive file. We recommend that you download the <emphasis>latest stable
                    release</emphasis>.</para>
            <para>Once the download has completed, launch the eXist-db installer. To launch the
                installer on Mac or Windows, simply double-click the .jar you downloaded. (On Mac OS
                X 10.7 and higher, a security feature called <ulink url="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290">Gatekeeper</ulink> may prevent the
                installer from running since eXist-db is not registered with Apple; to circumvent
                the warning dialog and allow the installer to run, right-click or control-click the
                file and select Open.) On Linux distributions with a graphical desktop interface
                (e.g., Ubuntu), you can launch the installer by making the .jar file executable,
                right-clicking on the .jar file, and selecting the "Open With ... Java" option. Or,
                to launch the installer from the command line, enter the following command:
                <synopsis format="linespecific">java -jar eXist-setup-[version]-revXXXXX.jar</synopsis>
                (Windows and Mac users can also use the command line procedure, but most users
                prefer the graphical installer. For installs on a headless system, see <ulink url="advanced-installation.xml#headless">Headless Installation</ulink>.)</para>
            <para>After the installer is launched, follow the prompts described below to complete
                the installation. We recommend that you accept the default options, since these are
                designed to make using eXist-db easy. The installer's dialog panes are as follows:</para>
            <procedure>
                <step>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Choose the Installation Directory</emphasis>: You will be
                        asked where to install eXist-db on your hard disk. The installer will
                        suggest an appropriate directory, but if you want, you can install
                        eXist-db anywhere on your system.</para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Choose the Data Directory</emphasis>: The data directory is where
                        eXist-db keeps its data files. The installer will suggest keeping the data
                        files inside the application directory, but you can select a different
                        location if you want.</para>
                    <para>For macOS users installing via disk image the default data directory will be:
                        <code>/Users/$username$/Library/Application Support/org.exist</code>
                    </para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Choose the Admin Password</emphasis>: The Admin Password is a
                        password for the eXist-db administrator account, or more commonly, the
                        "admin" account. This admin account belongs to you, and certain key
                        functions in eXist-db can only be performed by the admin. While you can
                        leave the admin password blank, we strongly recommend setting the
                        password in order to secure access your installation of eXist-db. Why?
                        Keep in mind that while eXist-db is running, it can be accessed by other
                        users on your local network (be it in your home or office, or at a cafe
                        or on a train). So, securing your administrator's account on eXist-db is
                        a good way to protect your data and prevent others from abusing the
                        account. Best to choose a unique password.</para>
                    <para>macOS users installing via disk image can change the default (empty) password via the <guimenuitem>Open dashboard</guimenuitem> option from the menubar icon once installation has finished.
                        <emphasis>special note:</emphasis> during the intial run of eXist-db its Dock icon may remain active even after eXist-db has been shut down. Simply right-click on the eXist-db Dock icon and select <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem>. On subsequent runs the dock icon should behave as expected. 
                    </para>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Memory Settings</emphasis>: Configure the maximum amount of
                        memory which will be available to Java (and eXist-db) and the portion of it
                        which will be reserved for internal caches. </para>
                    <graphic fileref="resources/installer1.png"/>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Select the Packs To Install</emphasis>: The "core" package is
                        required to run eXist-db, the "sources" package is optional. Removing
                        "sources" cuts the installation size considerably, but best to install
                        everything unless you are starved for disk space.  The "apps" package allows
                        you to select or deselect a number of applications which will be installed
                        into eXist-db when it starts the first time. If you are new to eXist-db, we
                        recommend to at least select "dashboard", "demo", "doc", "eXide" and
                        "fundocs". You'll need those to make your first steps in XQuery
                        development.</para>

                        Options</emphasis>: The installer can create convenient desktop
                        shortcuts and Start Menu entries for starting and accessing
                        eXist-db.</para>

            <para>On the Mac, double-click eXist-db's application icon where you installed eXist-db.
                On Linux or Windows, select the <emphasis>eXist-db Database Startup</emphasis>
                desktop shortcut icon or Start Menu entry you created at the end of the
