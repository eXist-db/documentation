            <title>Normal Start Up</title>
            <para>While eXist-db starts up, log output appears in the console. If you started
                eXist-db via the system tray launcher (default), the console output is captured and
                can be viewed by selecting the <guibutton>Show Tool Window</guibutton> menu entry in
                the system tray popup, then select <guibutton>Show console messages</guibutton>. If
                you launched eXist-db via one of the shell scripts, the output should directly
                appear in those.</para>
            <para>If eXist-db launched properly, you will find output similar to the following (this
                example output is taken from macOS):</para>

            <title>Database Refuses to Start</title>
            <para>If eXist-db was not shut down properly, it may start a recovery process to redo committed transactions and roll
            back uncommitted ones. If an inconsistency is found during this process, eXist-db will automatically abort the startup
            and print out a warning. This emergency stop is done to avoid potential damage and give an administrator a chance to check
            the db and create a backup. It does not necessarily indicate a real problem. In most cases, the db should be ok and restarting it will be save.</para>
            <para>However, we definitely recommend to run a <ulink url="backup.xml#consistency-check">consistency check</ulink> in those cases. If inconsistencies are found, make sure you
                have a backup before continuing. If only one or two resources are affected, it might still be ok to restart, but it's
                good to have a backup just in case.</para>

                    <para>If you do not have build.sh (or build.bat), you may just manually remove the contents of
                        your data directory. By default, the data directory is in <filename>EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/data</filename>

            <para>When using one of the shell or batch scripts, eXist-db can fail to start up properly if either of the two key environmental
                variables, <envar>JAVA_HOME</envar> and <envar>EXIST_HOME</envar>, are not set
                properly. Both variables are used in the <filename>startup.bat</filename> and
                <filename>startup.sh</filename> scripts and have to be set correctly before the
                scripts are run (you can also insert the lines required in the beginning of the
                scripts themselves).</para>

                        installed. For instructions about how to set JAVA_HOME on
                        Windows, follow the instructions in this <ulink url="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Setting+the+JAVA_HOME+Variable+in+Windows">guide</ulink>; on Linux, follow this <ulink url="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-set-java_home-path-variable/">guide</ulink>, and on macOS, follow this <ulink url="http://www.mehtanirav.com/2008/09/02/setting-java_home-on-mac-os-x-105">guide</ulink>. </para>

                        the server uses the path <filename>EXIST_HOME/conf.xml</filename>. For
                        example, if the <envar>EXIST_HOME</envar> path is <filename>C:\Program
                            Files\eXist</filename>, the server will look for <filename>C:\Program
                                Files\eXist\conf.xml</filename>. You can set EXIST_HOME in the same way
                        that you set JAVA_HOME; thus, on macOS, you would enter "export
                        EXIST_HOME=/Applications/eXist" in the Terminal. </para>

        <section id="port-conflicts">
            <title>Port Conflicts</title>
            <para>eXist-db can fail to start up if another service on
                your system is using port 8080 or 8443, the default ports that eXist's embedded web server, Jetty, uses. To see whether this is the case, enter <ulink url="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</ulink> in your browser. If
                another service occupies this port, you cannot start up eXist-db unless you shut
                down the service in question or make eXist-db use another port. To make eXist-db use
                another port, open the file <filename moreinfo="none">/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml</filename> inside your eXist-db installation in a
                text or XML editor and change the value "8080" in</para>

            <para>eXist-db uses port 8443 for confidential communication. Another service may also
                be using this port. To make eXist-db use another port, open the file <filename moreinfo="none">/tools/jetty/etc/jetty.xml</filename> and change the value

            <title>Using the Logs</title>
            <para>If you experience any problems while using eXist-db, your first step should be
                to check the log files to get additional information about the source of the
                problem. eXist-db uses the <emphasis>log4j-package</emphasis> to write output logs to
                files. By default, this output is written to the directory <filename moreinfo="none">webapp/WEB-INF/logs</filename>.
                Or, if you are running eXist as a service, check the directory <filename>tools/yajsw/logs</filename>. The
                main log files for eXist itself are <filename>exist.log</filename> and
                <filename>xmldb.log</filename>.

            <title>Out of Memory</title>
            <para>Running out of memory typically throws Java into an inconsistent state: some threads may still be alive and continue
            to run while others have died. It is thus important to avoid memory errors up front by checking the memory consumption of
            your queries before they go into production. Should you encounter an out of memory error, please make sure to restart
            eXist and follow the emergency procedure.</para>

                <title>Streaming Large Files</title>
                <para>If you have to generate large binaries, e.g. a ZIP or PDF, from within an XQuery, please ensure the content
                    does not need to be kept in memory. There are various XQuery functions which directly stream to the HTTP response.</para>
                <para>There's also a known issue with the betterform XForms filter caching every HTTP response. To work around this,
                your XQuery should be run via an URL which is not processed by the XForms filter: either disable the filter or use
                /rest or /restxq.</para>

            <title>Killing the Database</title>
            <para>If you ever feel you have to kill the database (e.g. because it does not respond - for whatever reason), the recommended 
                procedure is as follows:</para>

                <step>
                    <para>Check if a query is running wild and try to kill it. This can be done either through the
                    "Scheduler" plugin in the dashboard, or the "Running Jobs" section in the "Admin Web Client". Try to kill
                    the query there and wait for a minute if the system returns to normal operations:</para>

                    for the core database.</para>

                <step>
                    <para>It may now be safe to kill the eXist-db process. Check the logs to see if the database has properly
