            <title>Key Points to Learning XQuery</title>
            <para>This is a guide to help you learn XQuery. It contains some brief background
                information on XQuery and then lists a number of resources you can use to learn
                XQuery.</para>
            <para>XQuery is unique in the development stack in that it replaces both SQL and the
                traditional software layers that convert SQL into presentation formats such as HTML, PDF
                and ePub. XQuery can both retrieve information from your database and format it for
                presentation. </para>
            <para>Learning how to select basic data from an XML document can be learned in just a few
                hours if you are already familiar with SQL and other functional programming languages.
                However, learning how to create custom XQuery functions, how to design XQuery modules
                and how to execute unit tests on XQuery takes considerably longer.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Learning by Example</title>
                <para>Many people find that they learn a new language best by reading small examples of
                    code. One of the ideal locations for this is the <ulink url="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery#Beginning_Examples">XQuery Wikibook
                        Beginning Examples</ulink>
                </para>
                <para>These examples are all designed and tested to work with eXist.  Please let us know if
                    there are specific examples you would like to see.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Learning Functional Programming</title>
                <para>XQuery is a functional programming language, so many things that you do in
                    procedural programs are not recommended or not possible. In XQuery all variables
                    should be immutable, meaning they should be set once but never changed. This aspect
                    of XQuery allows it to be stateless and side-effect free.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Learning FLOWR statements</title>
                <para>Iteration in XQuery uses parallel programming statements called FLOWR statements.
                    Each loop of a FLOWR statement is performed in a separate thread of execution. As a
                    result you cannot use the output of any computation in a FLOWR loop as input to the
                    next loop. This concept can be difficult to learn if you have never used parallel
                    programming systems.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Learning XPath</title>
                <para>XQuery also includes the use of XPath to select various nodes from an XML document.  Note
                    that with native XML databases the shortest XPath expression is often the fastest since
                    short expressions use element indexes.  You may want to use a tool such as an XPath "builder" tool
                    within an IDE such as oXygen to learn how to build XPath expressions.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Using eXide</title>
                <para>eXist comes with a web-based tool for doing XQuery development called eXide.
                    Although this tool is not as advanced as a full IDE such as oXygen, it is ideal for
                    small queries if an IDE is not accessible.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Learning how to update XML documents</title>
                <para>eXist comes with a set of operations for updating on-disk XML documents.

                <title>Learning how to debug XQuery</title>
                <para>eXist has some support for step-by-step debugging of XQuery, but the interface is
                    not mature yet. Many people choose to debug complex recursive functions directly
                    within XML IDEs such as oXygen that support step-by-step debugging using the
                    internal Saxon XQuery library. The oXygen IDE allows you to set breakpoints and
                    watch the output document get created one element at a time. This process is
                    strongly recommended if you are learning topics like recursion. <ulink url="debugger.xml">eXist XQuery Debugger</ulink>

            <section>
                <title>Learning recursion in XQuery</title>
                <para>XML is an inherently recursive data structure: trees contain sub-trees, so many
                    XQuery functions for transforming documents are best designed using recursion. One
                    good place to start learning recursion is the identity node filter functions in the
                    XQuery wikibook.</para>
            </section>
            <section>
                <title>Effective use of your IDE</title>
                <para>Most developers who do XQuery more than a few hours a day eventually end up using
                    a full commercial XQuery IDE, with oXygen being the best integrated with eXist.
                    Setting up oXygen is a bit tricky the first time since you need to load five jar
                    files into a "driver" for oXygen. See <ulink url="oxygen.xml">Using oXygen</ulink>. Yet once this is done and the default XQuery
                    engine is set up to use eXist, there are many high-productivity features that are
                    enabled. Central to this is the XQuery auto-complete feature. As you type within
                    XQuery, all eXist functions and their parameters are shown in the IDE. For example
                    if you type "xmldb:" all the functions of the XMLDB module will automatically appear
                    in a drop-down list. As you continue to type or select a function the parameters and
                    types are also shown. This becomes a large time saver as you use more XQuery
                    functions.</para>
