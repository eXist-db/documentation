# Getting Help

## Community Support

Besides eXist-db's extensive [documentation](/exist/apps/doc), eXist-db has a large and active community of users and developers. The community uses mailing lists, chat, a wiki, and social media—to get and give help, follow the latest developments, and share tips and discoveries.

The book, "eXist: a NoSQL Document Database and Application Platform" was published in 2014 and is available from [O'Reilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026525.do).

The [exist-open](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/exist-open) mailing list is the primary forum for asking questions and getting help. Finding the answer to a question can sometimes be as simple as [searching the mailing list's archives](http://exist-open.markmail.org/search/?q=). Whether you have a question that you can't find the answer to, or you just want to join the discussion, [subscribe to the mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/exist-open)—it's free and you can unsubscribe anytime.

Besides exist-open, there is a mailing list dedicated solely to the XQuery language: the [xquery-talk mailing list](http://x-query.com/mailman/listinfo/talk). It's a great place to ask questions about XQuery, from basic to advanced.

Also, there are numerous excellent resources for learning XQuery, including the [XQuery wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery) and Priscilla Walmsley's [XQuery](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596006341.do) book (O'Reilly 2007).
