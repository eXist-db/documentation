            <para>The eXist-db <ulink url="quickstart.xml">Quick Start</ulink> document contains
                basic instructions for installing eXist. This article explains more advanced methods
                of installing and running eXist. </para>

            <title>Headless Installation</title>
            <para>The eXist-db installer requires a graphical desktop in order to launch. However,
                If you wish to install eXist-db on a headless system, use the
                    <command>-console</command> parameter when launching the installer from the
                command line. For example:</para>
            <synopsis>java -jar eXist-{version}.jar -console</synopsis>
            <para>In console mode, the installer will prompt for several parameters. It first asks
                for an installation directory. Please don't be confused if the output stops after
                showing the line "Select target path [...]": you are expected to enter a path or
                confirm the default by pressing <keysym>Enter</keysym>. A dump of a sample
                interaction is shown below:</para>

Set Data Directory
Please select a directory where eXist will keep its data files. On Vista and Windows 7, this should be outside the usual 'Program Files' directory:
Data dir:  [webapp/WEB-INF/data]

            <title>Running eXist-db as a Service</title>
            <para>Instead of manually running the eXist-db server in a shell window, you may prefer
                to run it as a background service which is automatically launched during system
                startup. This can be convenient, because eXist-db can continue to run even after
                users have logged off of the system.</para>
            <para>eXist-db comes with pre-configured scripts that use <ulink url="http://yajsw.sorceforge.net/">YAJSW (Yet Another Java Service Wrapper)</ulink> to handle
                the setup procedure. The required scripts are contained in the directory
                    <filename>tools/yajsw</filename>. 
                    </para>
            <section id="windows">
                <title>Windows</title>
                <para>
                    On Windows, you can simply choose the option
                to <emphasis>Install eXist-db as Service</emphasis> from the eXist-db menu created
                in the start menu. You can also call
                    <filename>tools/yajsw/bin/installService.bat</filename> instead. This will install
                eXist-db and Jetty as a Windows service.</para>
                <note>
                    <para>Installing eXist-db as a service on Windows Vista requires full administrator
                    rights. Right click on the start menu item and select "Run as administrator".
                    You may need to do this even if you are already logged in as an
                    administrator.</para>
                </note>
                <para>After executing the installService.bat script, you should find eXist-db listed in the
                list of services currently registered with Windows:</para>

                    <graphic fileref="resources/services.png"/>
                </screenshot>
                <para>Once the service is registered, you can launch it via the service manager, as shown
                in the screenshot, or from the command line:</para>

                <para>For Unix based systems (Linux, macOS) the start/shutdown scripts can be found in
                    <filename>tools/yajsw/bin/</filename>.</para>
                <para>The easiest way to get eXist-db started during 
                    initialization of the system is to run the following command: 
                    <synopsis>tools/yajsw/bin/installDaemon.sh</synopsis> 
                    This works for macOS and many Linux distributions.</para>
                <para>
                    Please note it might be required to set some variables for the specific system, e.g. "wrapper.app.account" (to have eXist-db started as a specific user) and "wrapper.plist.template" for launchd.
                    Details can be found on the YAJSW website: <ulink url="http://yajsw.sourceforge.net/YAJSW%20Configuration%20Parameters.html">YAJSW Configuration Options</ulink>.</para>
                <para>
		  If your system supports systemd you can run the
		  service wrapper as a non-privileged user. You will
		  be notified on choosing systemd non-privileged when
		  running the service wrapper installer:
		  <synopsis>tools/yajsw/bin/installDaemon.sh</synopsis>
		  You will also also be notified to remove it if you
