                        version is <emphasis>binary compatible</emphasis> with the old version, keep
                        the data directory (by default in <filename>webapp/WEB-INF/data</filename>)
                        of the old version. Note: A running instance of eXist-db needs to be stopped before copying files
                        from the data dir.</para>

            <title>Upgrading to 2.2</title>
            <para>The 2.2 release is not binary compatible with the 1.4.x series. You need to
                backup/restore.</para>
		<para>The bundled Lucene has been upgraded from 3.6.1
		to 4.4 with this release. Depending on what Lucene
		analyzers you are using you need to change the
		classnames in your
		<filename>collection.xconf</filename>s. E.g. KeywordAnalyzer
		and WhitespaceAnalyzer has moved into package
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core</filename>. Thus
		change, any occurrence of
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
		into
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
		and all other moved classes in the collection
		configurations and make sure you reindex your data
		before use. You get an error notice in the
		<filename>exist.log</filename> if you overlooked any
		occurrences.</para>

                            <para>eXist-db 2.0 closely follows the Unix security model (plus ACLs). Permissions have thus
                                changed between 1.4.x and 2.0. In particular, there's now an execute permission, which is
                                required to</para>

                                has been dropped because it was not used widely.</para>

                            <para>eXist-db 1.2.x used to create a default full text index on all
                                elements in the db. This has been <emphasis>disabled</emphasis>. The
                                main reasons for this are:</para>
                            <orderedlist>
                                <listitem>
                                    <para>maintaining the default index costs performance and
                                        memory, which could be better used for other indexes. The
                                        index may grow very fast, which can be a destabilizing
                                        factor.</para>
                                </listitem>

                                    <para>the index is unspecific. The query engine cannot use it as
                                        efficiently as a dedicated index on a set of named elements
                                        or attributes. Carefully creating your indexes by hand will
                                        result in much better performance.</para>

                                Cocoon samples in there. For the 1.5 version we completely
                                removed Cocoon support.</para>
