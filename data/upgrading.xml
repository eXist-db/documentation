                        of the old version. Note: A running instance of eXist-db needs to be stopped before copying files

            <title>Upgrading to 3.0 stable</title>
            <para>eXist-db v3.0 is not binary compatible with previous versions of eXist-db; the on-disk database file format has been updated, users should perform a full backup and restore to migrate their data.</para>
            <para>eXist.db v3.0 and subsequent versions now require <emphasis>Java 8</emphasis>; Users must update to Java 8!</para>
            <para>3.0 removes the the legacy Full Text Index and the  text (http://exist-db.org/xquery/text) XQuery module. Users should now look toward <code>fn:analyze-string</code>, e.g.
                <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>instead of using <code>text:groups()</code> use <code>analyze-string()//fn:group</code>,</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>instead of <code>text:filter("apparat", "([pr])")</code> use <code>analyze-string("apparat", "([pr])")//fn:match/string())</code>.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist>                
            </para>
            <para>Furthermore, the SOAP APi, SOAP server, and XACML Security features were removed.</para>
            <para>The versioning extension is now available as a separate <ulink url="https://github.com/eXist-db/xquery-versioning-module">EXPATH package</ulink></para>
            <para>XQueryService has been moved from <code>DBBroker</code> to <code>BrokerPool</code>.</para>
            <para>EXPath packages that incorporate Java libraries may no longer work with eXist-db v3.0 and may need to be recompiled for our API changes; packages should now explicitly specify the eXist-db versions that they are compatible with.</para>
            <para>eXist-db v3.0 is the culmination of almost 1,500 changes. For more information on new features head to the <ulink url="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist//eXist-db-v3">blog</ulink>.</para>

        <section>
            <title>Upgrading to 2.2 final</title>
            <para>The 2.2 release is not binary compatible with the 1.4.x series. You need to
                backup/restore. If you experience problems with user logins after the restore, please restart eXist-db.</para>
            <para>2.2 introduces a <emphasis>new range index module</emphasis>. Old index definitions will still work though as we made sure to keep backwards
                compatible. If you would like to upgrade to the new index, check its <ulink url="newrangeindex.xml">documentation</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The XQuery engine has been updated to support the changed syntax for <emphasis>maps in XQuery 3.1</emphasis>. The query parser will still accept the
                old syntax for map constructors though (<code>map { x:= "y"}</code> instead of <code>map { x: "y" }</code> in XQuery 3.1), so old
                code should run without modifications. All map module functions from XQuery 3.1 are 
                <ulink url="{fundocs}/view.html?uri=http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/map&amp;location=java:org.exist.xquery.functions.map.MapModule">available</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The signatures for some <emphasis>higher-order utility functions</emphasis> like fn:filter, fn:fold-left and fn:fold-right have changed as well. Please review your
                use of those functions. Also, fn:map is now called fn:for-each, though the old name is still accepted.</para>
            <para>The bundled Lucene has been upgraded from 3.6.1
		to 4.4 with this release. Depending on what Lucene
		analyzers you are using you need to change the
		classnames in your
		<filename>collection.xconf</filename>s. E.g. KeywordAnalyzer
		and WhitespaceAnalyzer has moved into package
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core</filename>. Thus
		change, any occurrence of
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
		into
		<filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
		and all other moved classes in the collection
		configurations and make sure you reindex your data
		before use. You get an error notice in the
		<filename>exist.log</filename> if you overlooked any
		occurrences.</para>

            <para>The 2.1 release is not binary compatible with the 1.4.x series. You need to
                backup/restore. 2.1 is binary compatible with 2.0 though.</para>

                            <para>eXist-db 2.0 closely follows the Unix security model (plus ACLs). Permissions have thus
                                changed between 1.4.x and 2.0. In particular, there's now an execute permission, which is

                            <para>eXist-db 1.2.x used to create a default full text index on all
                                elements in the db. This has been <emphasis>disabled</emphasis>. The
                                main reasons for this are:</para>
                            <orderedlist>
                                <listitem>
                                    <para>maintaining the default index costs performance and
                                        memory, which could be better used for other indexes. The
                                        index may grow very fast, which can be a destabilizing
                                        factor.</para>
                                </listitem>

                                    <para>the index is unspecific. The query engine cannot use it as
                                        efficiently as a dedicated index on a set of named elements
                                        or attributes. Carefully creating your indexes by hand will
                                        result in much better performance.</para>
