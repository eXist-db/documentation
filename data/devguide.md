# Developer's Guide

## Overview

This section provides a quick but broad introduction to the APIs and interfaces provided by eXist. To get started with XQuery development in eXist-db, you should first read the tutorial on [Getting Started with Web Application Development in eXist-db](development-starter.md).

In another chapter, we look at the basic [REST-style API](devguide_rest.md) and its available HTTP request operations. Following that, we address Java programmers, and focus on the [XML:DB API](devguide.mddb.md) - a standard Java API used to access native XML database services - and its extensions. We then discuss other ways to integrate eXist with Cocoon, including the XMLDBTransformer, and XSP Logicsheets. The following chapters examine the network APIs for [XML-RPC](devguide.mdrpc.md) and its methods - this includes the use of XUpdate. [SOAP interface](devguide_soap.md) is discussed as an alternative to XML-RPC. Finally, we include an important appendix of libraries required to implement specific APIs and interfaces.

## Embedding/Required Libraries

For more information on eXist libraries and how to embed eXist into your own application, please refer to the corresponding section in the [Deployment Guide](deployment.md#embedded).
