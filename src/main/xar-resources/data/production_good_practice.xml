            <abstract>
                <para>From our and our clients' experiences of developing and using eXist-db in production environments a number of lessons have been learned. This Good Practice guide is an attempt to cover some of the considerations that should be taken into account when deploying eXist-db for use in a production environment.</para>
                <para>The concepts laid out within this document should not be considered absolute or accepted wholesale - they should rather be used as suggestions to guide users in their eXist-db deployments.</para>

            <title>The Server</title>
            <para>Ensure that your server is up-to-date and patched with any necessary security fixes.</para>
            <para>eXist-db is written in Java - so for performance and security reasons, please ensure that you have the latest and greatest Java JDK release installed. At present this is the 1.6 <!--1.7--> branch, details of the latest version can always be found here - <ulink url="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</ulink>

            <title>Install from Source or Release?</title>
            <para>Most users will install an officially released version of eXist-db on their production systems, usually this is perfectly fine. However there can be advantages to installing eXist-db from source code on a production system.</para>
            <para>eXist-db may be installed from source code to a production system in one of two ways -</para>

                        <para>You checkout the eXist-db code for a release branch (or trunk) from our GitHub repository to a local machine, from here you build a distribution which you test and then deploy to your live server.</para>

                        <para>In this case you don't use a local machine for building an eXist-db distribution, but you checkout the code from a release branch (or the develop branch) directly from our GitHub repository on your server and build it in-situ.</para>

                    <para>eXist-db should be deployed and configured to run whilst following the security best practices of the operating system on which it is deployed.</para>
                    <para>Typically we would recommend creating an "exist" user account and "exist" user group with no login privileges (i.e. no shell and empty password), changing the permissions of the eXist-db installation to be owned by that user and group, and then running eXist-db using those credentials. An example of this on OpenSolaris might be -</para>

                <para>eXist-db is no exception and should be configured for your production systems so that it provides only what you need and no more.

            <para>eXist-db provides 3 different mechanisms for performing backups - </para>

            <para>Each of these backup mechanisms is schedulable either with eXist-db or with your operating system scheduler. See the <ulink url="backup.xml">backup</ulink> page and conf.xml for further details.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Web Deployments</title>
            <para>eXist-db like any Web Application Server (Tomcat, WebLogic, GlassFish, etc.) should not be directly exposed to the Web. Instead, we would strongly recommend proxying your eXist-db powered Web Application through a Web Server such as <ulink url="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</ulink> or <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPD</ulink>. See <ulink url="production_web_proxying.xml">here</ulink> for further details.</para>
            <para>If you proxy eXist-db through a Web Server, then you may also configure your firewall to only allow external access directly to the Web Server. If done correctly this also means that web users will not be able to access any eXist-db services except your application which is proxyied into the Web Servers namespace.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Enable GZip Compression</title>
                <para>eXist-db by default operates inside the Jetty Application Server, Jetty
                    (and most other Java Application Servers) provides a mechanism for enabling
                    dynamic GZip compression of resources. This is to say that Jetty can be
                    configured to dynamically GZip compress any resource received from the server by
                    HTTP. Potentially for large resources, or even for frequently used resources.
                    Enabling dynamic GZip compression can reduce the size of transfers, and as such
                    reduce the transfer time of resources from the server to the client, hopefully
                    resulting in a faster experience for the end-user.</para>
                <para>GZip Compression can be enabled in web.xml, which can be found in either
                    $EXIST_HOME/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml for default deployments or
                    $EXIST_HOME/tools/jetty/etc/standalone/WEB-INF/web.xml for standalone
                    deployments.</para>
