  <para>This article discusses eXist-db's database backup/restore procedures and related details</para>

  <!-- ================================================================== -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Backup Format</title>

    <para>During backup, eXist-db exports the contents of its database (both XML and binary files) to a hierarchy of directories on the hard drive.
      This hierarchy is organized according to the organization of collections in the database.</para>
    <para>The location of the backup files depends on backup method. Backups via the dashboard or XQuery write backups into the <code>export</code>
      directory inside the data directory of the eXist instance. The Emergency Backup Tool writes into <code>$EXIST_HOME/export</code>, unless
      configured otherwise. Other methods (e.g. <link xlink:href="ant-tasks"><code>Ant</code></link> tasks) are fully configurable.</para>
    <para>The files stored during backup include index configuration files and user settings. Resource and collection metadata is exported to a
      special XML file, called <literal>__contents__.xml</literal>, which lists information including the resource type, owner, modification date
      and/or the permissions assigned to a resource. You will find one <literal>__contents__.xml</literal> file in each directory created by the
      backup. This descriptor file is required to restore the backup.</para>
    <para>Since eXist-db uses an open XML format rather than a proprietary format for its database files, users can manually modify files in the
      backup directories without requiring special software. Any changes made to these files are reflected in the database with a restore or when the
      data is imported to another database system.</para>
    <para>It is even possible to directly edit user data and permissions stored in the file <literal>/db/system/users.xml</literal>. This is
      particularly useful when making global changes to the user database. For example, to reset the passwords for all your users, you can simply edit
      the file <literal>users.xml</literal> by removing the <literal>password</literal> attribute or set it to a default value, and restore the
      document(s).</para>
    <para>During backups eXist first runs a consistency check on the database, trying to identify potential issues in the internal storage structure.
      Based on the result of the check, the backup task attempts to rescue as much data as possible, working around any detected issues.</para>
    <warning>
      <para> When migrating to a new eXist-db version, take care to use a version of the client corresponding to your server version. Usually, the
        backup process is backwards compatible. However, using a newer client version to create the backup from a server running an older version may
        sometimes lead to unexpected problems.</para>
      <para>Backup also generates a report. Normally this contains the list of collections which were backed up. If you notice any warnings or
        errors, it is especially important that you perform a “full restore” of your backed-up data onto the new installation of eXist, as described
        in the <link xlink:href="backup#restore">following steps.</link>
      </para>
    </warning>
    <important>
      <para>Due to limitations of the ZIP format, please make sure the size of your zipped backup does not exceed 4 gigabytes. All backup methods
        support backups to the file system as an alternative.</para>
    </important>
  </sect1>

  <!-- ================================================================== -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Backup Methods</title>

    <para>There are two main methods for creating a backup:</para>
    <variablelist spacing="compact">
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Client-side</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can use the Java admin client or a small command line utility to create a backup of the data on the server. In this case, the
            client controls the backup process. The server is not blocked and continues to accept requests from other clients. Other users can modify
            the db while the backup is running, so logical dependencies between different resources may not be preserved correctly.</para>
          <para>Client-side backups are <emphasis>not safe</emphasis>. The client uses the XML:DB API to access the db. This means that it cannot
            backup documents or collections if they are damaged in any way.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Server-side</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Server-side backups are usually run through eXist-db's job scheduler, though they can also be triggered via the web interface. This
            type of backup extracts the data directly from the low-level database files. It is thus much faster then a client-side backup. It also
            supports incremental backups.</para>
          <para>It is guaranteed that the database is in a consistent state while the backup is running. Possible corruptions in the db will be
            detected and the backup process will try to work around them. In many cases, damaged resources can at least be partially recovered.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>The format of the generated backup archives will be the same for both backup methods. They can all be restored via the standard Java
      client.</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- ================================================================== -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Server-side Backup</title>

    <para>This is now the recommended backup method. To guarantee consistency, server-side backups are always executed as system tasks, which means
      that the database will be switched to a protected service mode before the backup starts. eXist-db will wait for all pending transactions to
      complete before it enters protected mode. A database checkpoint will be performed and the backup task is executed. While the system task is
      running, no new transactions will be allowed. Concurrent requests by other clients will be blocked and added to the internal queue. Once the
      backup is complete, the database will switch back to normal service and all locks will be released.</para>
    <para>You can trigger the backup via the Dashboard:</para>
    <informalfigure>
      <mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="assets/Backup.png"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </informalfigure>
    <para>Clicking the <literal>Trigger</literal> button will schedule a single backup task. The server will wait for all running transactions to
      return before it executes the task. You can click on <literal>Refresh</literal> to update the view, which lists all backup archives currently
      available within the standard backup directory. Click on the name of an archive to download it.</para>
    <para>Beginning with version 1.2.5, eXist-db can also create <emphasis>incremental backups</emphasis>. Only resources which were modified since
      the last backup are archived.</para>
    <para>All backups will be stored in ZIP format into a directory <literal>export/</literal> below the main data directory, which means
        <literal>webapp/WEB-INF/data/export/</literal> by default (unless you configured a different data directory in
      <literal>conf.xml</literal>).</para>
  </sect1>

  <!-- ================================================================== -->

  <sect1>
    <title>Automatic Consistency Check</title>

    <para>The system task runs a consistency and sanity check on the database before backing it up. Reports of this check are written into the same
      directory as the backup archive. The last report can also be viewed via JMX (see below).</para>
    <para>The consistency check will first check the collection hierarchy, then scan through the stored node tree of every document in the db, testing
      node properties like the node's id, child count, attribute count and node relationships. Contrary to normal database operations, the different
      dbx files are checked independently. This means that even if a collection is no longer readable, the tool will still be able to scan the
      documents in the damaged collection.</para>
    <para>The backup task uses the information provided by the consistency check to work around damages in the db. It tries to export as much data as
      possible, even if parts of the collection hierarchy are corrupted or documents are damaged:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Descendant collections will be exported properly even if their ancestor collection is corrupted</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Documents which are intact but belong to a destroyed collection will be stored into a special collection
            <literal>/db/lost_and_found</literal>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Damaged documents are detected and are removed from the backup</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <sect2>
      <title>Scheduling Backups and Consistency Checks</title>

      <para>The core class for the server-side backup as well as consistency checks is called <literal>ConsistencyCheckTask</literal>. It can be
        registered as a system task with eXist-db's <link xlink:href="configuration.xml#N104CF">scheduler</link>. To do this, add the following definition to the scheduler section in <literal>conf.xml</literal>:</para>
      <example>
        <title>Job Definition in conf.xml</title>
        <programlisting language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-1.xml"/>
      </example>
      <para>This will launch a consistency check and database backup every 12 hours, starting at midnight. The time/frequency of the backup is
        specified in the <literal>cron-trigger</literal> attribute. The syntax is borrowed from the Unix cron utility, though there are small
        differences. Please consult the Quartz documentation about <link xlink:href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/tutorial-lesson-06.html">CronTrigger</link>
        configuration.</para>
      <para>The task accepts the following parameters:</para>
      <variablelist spacing="compact">
        <varlistentry>
          <term>output</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>The directory to which the backup is written. Relative paths are interpreted relative to eXist-db's main data directory.</para>

        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>backup</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Create a full database backup in addition to running the system checks. Setting this to "no" will not create a backup - unless
              errors were detected during the consistency check! If errors are found, the task will always try to generate an emergency backup.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>zip</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If set to "yes", the backup will be written into a zip archive. For larger databases, please make sure the generated archive is
              smaller than 4 gigabytes. Due to limitations of the zip format, archives larger than 4 gigabytes may not be readable. In this case, use
              a backup to the file system instead.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>incremental</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Created backups will be incremental. Only resources which were modified since the last backup will be saved. The first backup will
              always be a full backup, subsequent backups will be incremental.</para>
            <para>Note: you can schedule more than one backup job. For example, an incremental backup could be done multiple times a day while a full
              backup is created only once during the night </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>incremental-check</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>By default, no consistency check will be run during an incremental backup. For big databases, the consistency check may take too
              long, so it should be done for full backups only. Set <literal>incremental-check</literal> to "yes" to run a consistency check during
              incremental backups.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>max</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>If incremental backups are enabled, create a full backup every <literal>max</literal> backup runs. If you set the parameter to e.g.
              2, you will get a full backup after two incremental backups.</para>

      indicate the <emphasis>target directory</emphasis> on your system. You can also specify the current admin username using the
        <literal>-u</literal> parameter, and the admin password using the <literal>-p</literal> parameter. For example, to backup the entire database
      on a Unix system to the target directory <literal>/var/backup/hd060501</literal>, you would enter the following:</para>
    <programlisting>bin/backup.sh -u admin -p admin-pass -b /db -d /var/backup/hd060501</programlisting>
    <para>By default, the utility connects to the database at the URI: <literal>xmldb:exist://localhost:8080/exist/xmlrpc</literal>. If you want to
      backup a database at a different location, specify its <literal>XML:DB URI</literal> (excluding any collection path) using the
        <literal>-ouri</literal> parameter. For example, the following backup on a Unix Tomcat system running on port 80 specifies the database URI
        <literal>xmldb:exist://192.168.1.2:80/xmlrpc</literal>
    </para>

        <title>Using the Command Line</title>

        <para>To restore from a backup using the command-line utility, follow the instructions above for launching <literal>bin/backup.sh</literal>
          (Unix), OR the <literal>bin/backup.bat</literal> (Windows/DOS) script files. Include the <literal>-r</literal> parameter, and the full path
          of the <literal>__contents__.xml</literal> file to restore. As with the Admin Client, if the backup uses a different password for the
          "admin" user than the current session, you must specify the backup password using the <literal>-P</literal>. For Example:</para>
        <programlisting xlink:href="listings/listing-10.txt"/>

      <title>Repairing the Package Repository After Restore</title>

      <para>After a complete restore, your package repository will probably be out of sync. The dashboard will not show all the packages you had
        previously installed, even though their data collections have hopefully been restored (into <literal>/db/apps</literal> unless you changed the
        default repository root).</para>
      <para>This happens because the package registry is stored on the file system and is not part of a backup. During a restore, only the contents of
        your packages are written back into the database.</para>
      <para>A manual "repair" step is required to get the package repository into sync again. The repair procedure is implemented as an XQuery module,
        which you can run via eXide or the Java admin client. The module provides two functions:</para>
      <variablelist spacing="compact">
        <varlistentry>
          <term>repair:clean-all()</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Unlinks all currently installed packages from the package manager without removing deployed data from the db.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>repair:repair()</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Scan the app root collection in the db for deployed packages and register each of them with the package repository. This
              reconstructs the metadata for the package. The data stored in the db will not be modified in any way.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>repair:repair ($collection)</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>Only try to repair the application whose deployed data is stored in the given collection.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>After a complete restore into a clean database, the clean-all and repair functions would typically be combined in the following
        XQuery:</para>

      <title>Standalone Backup/Restore on Server platforms</title>

      <para>The above instructions assume that you have a standard eXist installation directory in place, either from a release package or a full
        build environment. That is not always the case on remotely deployed server instances that might be running using only an eXist WAR file in an
        application server (eg. Tomcat).</para>
      <para>To support such deployment scenarios, and make it easier to do restores local to the deployed server, there is an ant build target called: </para>
      <programlisting>backrest</programlisting>
      <para>Building the backrest target will create a fully-self contained zip file in the backrest directory that can be copied to a remote server
        and used to do both restores and backups local to that server. </para>
