            <para>eXist-db provides an extension to XQuery for updating nodes in the database. The
                extension makes the following operations possible using a simple syntax: insert,
                delete, replace, update value, and rename.</para>

                <title>Relationship to W3C Recommendation</title>
                <para>This extension was created well before the W3C working group created the
                        <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-10/">XQuery Update Facility
                        1.0</ulink> recommendation, and it differs substantially from the
                    recommendation. However, it remains perfectly functional and is still the
                    primary method (besides <ulink url="http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/xupdate/"
                        >XUpdate</ulink>) for updating nodes.</para>

                <title>Persistent Document Updates</title>
                <para>The XQuery update extension has been designed around updating
                        <emphasis>persistent</emphasis> documents stored in the database. It is not
                    suitable for updating temporary document fragments constructed within an query,
                    i.e., you can't use it to modify the results returned by a query. For example,
                    the following query has no visible effect because it operates on an XML node
                    constructed in-memory: </para>
                <synopsis language="xquery"><![CDATA[let $node := <root><a/></root>
return 
    update insert <b/> into $node/a
]]></synopsis>
                <para>Since $node is an in-memory constructed element, rather than a node stored in
                    the database, the query has no effect and simply returns the empty
                    element.</para>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section id="syntax">
            <title>Update Syntax</title>
            <para>All update statements start with the keyword "update", followed by an update
                action. Available actions are: "insert", "delete", "replace", "value" and "rename".
                The return type of the expression is <option>empty()</option>. </para>
            <para>An update statement may occur at any position within the XQuery main code or a
                function body. </para>
            <warning>
                <para>When using an update within the return clause of a FLWOR expression, be
                    cautious when deleting or replacing nodes that are still being used by enclosing
                    code. This is because a delete or replace will be processed immediately, and the
                    deleted or replaced node will no longer be available to the query. Such actions
                    can corrupt the database. For example, the following expression will throw the
                    database into an inconsistent state if //address returns more than one
                    node:</para>
                <example>
                    <title>An unsafe update</title>
                    <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[
for $address in //address
return
    update delete //address
]]></programlisting>
                </example>
                <para>However, an expression like the following is safe as it only modifies the
                    current iteration variable (note that the following example deletes $address
                    (the current iteration variable) rather than //address (all addresses in the
                    database, including others that have not been deleted yet):</para>
                <example>
                    <title>A safe update</title>
                    <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[
for $address in //address
return
    update delete $address
]]></programlisting>
                </example>
                <para>Aside from this caveat, eXist-db's XQuery update extension is safe to
                    use.</para>
