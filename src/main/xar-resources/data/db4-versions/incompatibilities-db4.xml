        <title>Known Issues for Binary Non-compatible Upgrades</title>
        <section id="v3.0.0">
            <title>Upgrading to 3.0 stable</title>
            <para>eXist-db v3.0 is not binary compatible with previous versions of eXist-db; the on-disk database file format has been updated, users should perform a full backup and restore to migrate their data.</para>
            <para>eXist.db v3.0 and subsequent versions now require <emphasis>Java 8</emphasis>; Users must update to Java 8!</para>
            <para>3.0 removes the the legacy Full Text Index and the  text (http://exist-db.org/xquery/text) XQuery module. Users should now look toward <code>fn:analyze-string</code>, e.g.
                <orderedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>instead of using <code>text:groups()</code> use <code>analyze-string()//fn:group</code>,</para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>instead of <code>text:filter("apparat", "([pr])")</code> use <code>analyze-string("apparat", "([pr])")//fn:match/string())</code>.</para>
                    </listitem>
                </orderedlist>                
            </para>
            <para>Furthermore, the SOAP APi, SOAP server, and XACML Security features were removed.</para>
            <para>The versioning extension is now available as a separate <ulink url="https://github.com/eXist-db/xquery-versioning-module">EXPATH package</ulink>
            </para>
            <para>XQueryService has been moved from <code>DBBroker</code> to <code>BrokerPool</code>.</para>
            <para>EXPath packages that incorporate Java libraries may no longer work with eXist-db v3.0 and may need to be recompiled for our API changes; packages should now explicitly specify the eXist-db versions that they are compatible with.</para>
            <para>eXist-db v3.0 is the culmination of almost 1,500 changes. For more information on new features head to the <ulink url="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/wiki/blogs/eXist//eXist-db-v3">blog</ulink>.</para>
        </section>
        <section id="v2.2">
            <title>Upgrading to 2.2 final</title>
            <para>The 2.2 release is not binary compatible with the 1.4.x series. You need to
                backup/restore. If you experience problems with user logins after the restore, please restart eXist-db.</para>
            <para>2.2 introduces a <emphasis>new range index module</emphasis>. Old index definitions will still work though as we made sure to keep backwards
                compatible. If you would like to upgrade to the new index, check its <ulink url="newrangeindex.xml">documentation</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The XQuery engine has been updated to support the changed syntax for <emphasis>maps in XQuery 3.1</emphasis>. The query parser will still accept the
                old syntax for map constructors though (<code>map { x:= "y"}</code> instead of <code>map { x: "y" }</code> in XQuery 3.1), so old
                code should run without modifications. All map module functions from XQuery 3.1 are 
                <ulink url="{${fundocs.pkg.abbrev}}/view.html?uri=http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/map&amp;location=java:org.exist.xquery.functions.map.MapModule">available</ulink>.</para>
            <para>The signatures for some <emphasis>higher-order utility functions</emphasis> like fn:filter, fn:fold-left and fn:fold-right have changed as well. Please review your
                use of those functions. Also, fn:map is now called fn:for-each, though the old name is still accepted.</para>
            <para>The bundled Lucene has been upgraded from 3.6.1
                to 4.4 with this release. Depending on what Lucene
                analyzers you are using you need to change the
                classnames in your
                <filename>collection.xconf</filename>s. E.g. KeywordAnalyzer
                and WhitespaceAnalyzer has moved into package
                <filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core</filename>. Thus
                change, any occurrence of
                <filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
                into
                <filename>org.apache.lucene.analysis.core.WhitespaceAnalyzer</filename>
                and all other moved classes in the collection
                configurations and make sure you reindex your data
                before use. You get an error notice in the
                <filename>exist.log</filename> if you overlooked any
                occurrences.</para>

                            <para>eXist-db 2.0 closely follows the Unix security model (plus ACLs). Permissions have thus
                                changed between 1.4.x and 2.0. In particular, there's now an execute permission, which is

                                has been dropped because it was not used widely.</para>

                            <para>eXist-db 1.2.x used to create a default full text index on all
                                elements in the db. This has been <emphasis>disabled</emphasis>. The
                                main reasons for this are:</para>
                            <orderedlist>

                                    <para>maintaining the default index costs performance and
                                        memory, which could be better used for other indexes. The
                                        index may grow very fast, which can be a destabilizing
                                        factor.</para>

                                    <para>the index is unspecific. The query engine cannot use it as
                                        efficiently as a dedicated index on a set of named elements
                                        or attributes. Carefully creating your indexes by hand will
                                        result in much better performance.</para>
