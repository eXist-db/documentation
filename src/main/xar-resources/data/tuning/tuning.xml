  <para>This article describes strategies for improving the performance of eXist-db and optimizing
    its efficiency. It covers subjects that constrain performance, from memory and cache settings to
    the way a query is constructed. </para>

    <title>Memory settings</title>

    <para>Java always limits the maximum amount of memory available to a process. So eXist-db will
      not automatically use all of the available memory on your machine. </para>
    <para>The maximum amount of memory Java will allocate is determined by the
        <literal>-Xmx</literal> parameter passed to Java on the command line. </para>
    <para>When eXist-db is started via the graphical launcher or via one of the shell or batch
      scripts, memory settings are read from the file <literal>vm.properties</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="listings/listing-1.txt"/>


    <para>For <emphasis>Unix</emphasis> systems, this is done in
        <literal>$EXIST_HOME/bin/functions.d/eXist-settings.sh</literal>, with the
        <literal>JAVA_OPTIONS</literal> variable. The <literal>CLIENT_JAVA_OPTIONS</literal>
      variable does the same for the Java admin client. You can override those variables globally in
      your own shell.</para>
    <para>On <emphasis>Windows</emphasis>,this is done in the main <code>.bat</code> files, for
      instance <literal>$EXIST_HOME\bin\startup.bat</literal>.</para>
    <para>If you launch <emphasis>eXist-db as a service</emphasis>, all Java settings will be

  <sect1>
    <title>Cache settings</title>

    <para>Each of the core database files and indexes has a page cache. The main purpose of this
      cache is to make sure that the most frequently used pages of these files are kept in memory.
      If a file's cache is too small, eXist starts to unload pages, only to reload them a few moment
      later. This "trashing effect" results in an immediate performance drop, in particular while
      indexing documents.</para>
    <para>All caches share a single memory pool, whose size is determined by the attribute
        <literal>cacheSize</literal> in the <tag>db-connection</tag> section of
        <literal>conf.xml</literal>:</para>
    <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-3.txt"/>
    <para>The global cache manager will dynamically grant more memory to caches while they are under
      load and free memory used by idle caches.</para>
    <para>The default setting for <literal>cacheSize</literal> is very conservative (48M). It is ok
      for smaller databases, but you may soon experience a performance drop when indexing more than
      several 100M of XML data. Consider increasing <literal>cacheSize</literal> up to approximately
      1/3 of the main memory available to Java (determined by the <literal>-Xmx</literal> parameter
      passed to the Java command line). If you are running eXist-db with other web applications in
      the same servlet engine, you may need to choose a smaller setting.</para>
    <warning>
      <para>Running out of memory will crash the database, be careful!</para>
    </warning>
    <para>The <literal>cacheSize</literal> is mostly relevant for storing/updating data. The effect
      on query speed is negligible (unless the index caches are much too small).</para>
    <para>If you continue to experience performance issues while storing data, revisit your index
      configuration. Removing unused indexes provides more room to the other indexes. In particular,
      the full text index can grow very fast until it becomes a bottleneck. Try to disable the
      default full text index (see below).</para>
    <para>The <literal>nodesBuffer</literal> attribute can be used to set eXist-db's temporary
      internal buffer to a fixed size. This buffer is used during indexing to cache nodes before
      they are flushed to disk. The default setting (<code>nodesBuffer="-1"</code>) means use as
      much memory as is available. This can be problematic if you store large documents in a
      multi-user environment. For a production server, it is recommended to set
        <code>nodesBuffer</code> to <code>1000</code> or less when there are many concurrent write
      operations.</para>

      <title>Don't rely on the default behaviour</title>

      <para>eXist-db does <emphasis>not</emphasis> index element or attribute values by default. For
        example, assume the following query without an index:</para>
      <programlisting>//SPEECH[SPEAKER = "HAMLET"]</programlisting>
      <para>The query engine will perform a full scan over all <tag>SPEAKER</tag> elements in the
        database. This is very slow and limits concurrency. You should at least create a global
        index definition (in <literal>/db/system/config/db/collection.xconf</literal>) and add range
        indexes for the most frequently used comparisons.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="idxdefs">
      <title>Prefer simple index definitions</title>

      <para>Keeping your <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="indexing">index definitions</link> simple makes it easier for the query optimizer to resolve
        dependencies. </para>
      <para>In particular, avoid context-dependant index definitions unless you really have a reason
        to use them. A context-dependant index is defined on a path like
          <code>/book/chapter/title</code>. General indexes are defined on a simple element or
        attribute qname. For instance:</para>
      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-6.xml"/>
      <para>Defining indexes on qnames may result in a larger index, but allows the query engine to
        apply all available optimization techniques. This can improve query times by an order of
        magnitude. Replacing a context-dependant index by a simple index on qname can therefore
        result in a performance boost.</para>

    <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Use range indexes on strongly typed data or short strings</title>

      <para>Range indexes work with the standard XQuery operators and string functions. For
        instance:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">//book[year = 2000]</programlisting>
      <para>This will always be slow without an index: eXist-db scans over every <tag>year</tag>
        element in the db, casting its string value to an integer.</para>
      <para>For queries on string content, range indexes work well for exact comparisons
          (<code>author = 'Joe Doe'</code>) or regular expressions (<code>matches(author,
          "^Joe.*")</code>) You can also use a full text index for the latter. </para>
      <para>Range indexes on strings are by default <emphasis>case-sensitive</emphasis>. To be more
        precise: they are sensitive to the default <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation" condition="_blank">collation</link>.
        If you need case-insensitive queries, consider using an ngram index.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Consider an n-gram index for exact substring queries on longer text sequences</title>

      <para>While range indexes tend to become slow for substring queries (like
          <code>contains(title, "XSLT 2.0")</code>), an n-gram index is nearly as fast as a full
        text index. It also indexes whitespace and punctuation and is
          <emphasis>case-insensitive</emphasis>. </para>
      <para>For example, <code>ngram:contains(title, "XSLT 2.0")</code> will only match titles
        containing the <emphasis>exact</emphasis> phrase "XSLT 2.0". </para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Choose a full-text index for tokenizable text where whitespace/punctuation is mostly
        irrelevant</title>

      <para>The full text index is very fast and should be used whenever you need to query for a
        sequence of separate words or tokens in a longer text. It might even be faster to
        post-process the returned node set and filter out wrong matches than using a, usually much
        slower, regular expression!</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Writing Queries</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Prefer short paths</title>

      <para>eXist-db uses internal indexes to directly locate an element or attribute by name. It
        doesn't need to <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal" condition="_blank">traverse</link> the document tree. This means that direct selection of a node through a
        single descendant step is <emphasis>faster</emphasis> than walking the child axis. For
        example:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">a/b/c/d/e/f</programlisting>
      <para>This will be <emphasis>slower</emphasis> than</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">a//f</programlisting>
      <para>The first expression requires 6 (!) index lookups where the second just needs two. The
        same applies to the ancestor axis, for instance <code>f/ancestor::a</code>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Always process the most selective filter/expression first</title>

      <para>If you need multiple steps to select nodes from a larger node set, try to process the
        most selective steps first. The earlier you reduce the node set to process, the faster your
        query. </para>
      <para>For example, assume we have to find publications written by "Bjarne Stroustrup",
        published after the year 2000:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">/dblp/*[year &gt; 2000][author = 'Bjarne Stroustrup']</programlisting>
      <para>The database has 568824 records matching <code>year &gt; 2000</code>, but only 41 of
        them were written by Stroustrup. Moving the filter on the author to the front of the
        expression results in better performance:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">/dblp/*[author = 'Bjarne Stroustrup'][year &gt; 2000]</programlisting>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Avoid unnecessary nested filters</title>

      <para>Nesting filters in an XPath expression is often required and eXist-db will process them
        correctly. However, unnecessary nesting should be avoided because it has a negative impact
        on the query optimizer.</para>
      <para>For example: <code>//A[B[C = "D"]]</code> could also be written as <code>//A[B/C =
          "D"]</code> without changing the result. The variant with only one filter is easier to
        optimize for eXist-db.</para>
      <para>Likewise, if you are calling one of the optimized functions (<code>contains</code>,
          <code>matches</code>, <code>ft:query</code>, etc.), make sure you do not nest them, unless
        really required. For instance <code>//A[B/C[contains(., "D")]]</code> can be rewritten as
          <code>//A[contains(B/C, "D")]</code>.</para>

    </sect2>

    <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

    <sect2>
      <title>Allow eXist-db to process large node sets in one step</title>

      <para>The query engine is optimized to process a path expression in a single operation. For
        instance:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[B = 'C']</programlisting>
      <para>This is evaluated in a single operation for all context items. It doesn't make a
        difference if the input set comes from a single large document, includes all the documents
        in a specific collection or even the entire database. The logic of the operation remains the
        same.</para>
      <para>However, "bad" queries can force the query engine to partition the input sequence and
        process it in an item-by-item mode. For example, most function calls will force the query
        engine into item-by-item mode:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[f:process(B) = 'C']</programlisting>
      <para>The query engine needs to call a (non-optimized) function for each <tag>B</tag> and will
        therefore process the entire comparison once for every context item.</para>
      <para>There are functions to which the above does not apply. This includes most functions
        which operate on indexes, e.g. <code>contains</code>, <code>matches</code>,
          <code>starts-with</code>, <code>ngram:contains</code>, etc. These calls are optimized,
        eXist-db only needs to call them once to process the entire context set. For example, using
          <code>ngram:contains</code> like in <code>//A/*[ngram:contains(B, 'C')]</code> is ok. But
          <code>//A/*[ngram:contains(f:process(B), 'C')]</code> will again force eXist-db into
        step-by-step evaluation.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Prefer XPath predicates over where expressions</title>

      <para>This is a variation of what was discussed above. Many users formulate SQL-style queries
        using an explicit "where" clause:</para>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-21.txt"/>
      <para>This could be rewritten as:</para>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-22.txt"/>
      <para>The "<code>for … where</code>" expression forces the query engine into a step-by-step
        iteration over the input sequence, testing each instance of <code>$e</code> against the
          <code>where</code> expression. Any possible optimizations are lost.</para>
      <para>However, the XPath predicate expression can be processed in one single step, making best
        use of available indexes. There are of course cases which cannot be handled without using
          <code>where</code> (for instance joins between multiple documents), but you don't use
          <code>where</code> if you can replace it by a simple XPath predicate.</para>
      <para>The query engine will always <emphasis>try</emphasis> to process a <code>where</code>
        clause like an equivalent XPath with predicate, but it only detects the simple cases.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Use general comparisons to compare an item to a list of alternatives</title>

      <para>General comparisons are handy if you need to compare something to multiple values. For
        example, you could use an "or" to find all <tag>b</tag> children whose string value is
        either <code>"c"</code> or <code>"d"</code>:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">//a[b eq 'c' or b eq 'd']</programlisting>
      <para>A shorter and more efficient way to express this is:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">//a[b = ('c', 'd')]</programlisting>
      <para>If an index is defined on <tag>b</tag>, eXist-db will need only one index lookup to find
        all b's matching the comparison. The equivalent "or" expression needs two separate index
        lookups.</para>

      <title>Use "group by"</title>

      <para>The XQuery 3.0 <code>group by</code> feature is more efficient than using the
          <code>distinct-values</code> function. For example, to order the results of a query by the
        value of the child element <tag>SPEAKER</tag>:</para>
      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-25.txt"/>
      <para>The XQuery 3.0 variant with <code>group by</code> is much more efficient:</para>

      <title>Querying multiple collections</title>

      <para>You could use a <code>for</code> loop to query over multiple collections on the same
        level in the collection hierarchy. However, this forces the query engine to process the
        remaining expression once for each collection. It is more efficient to construct the initial
        node set once and use it as input for the main expression. For example:</para>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-27.txt"/>
      <para>This will be less efficient than:</para>

      <title>Use the ancestor or parent axis instead of a top-down approach</title>

      <para>eXist-db can navigate the ancestor axis as fast as the descendant axis. It can therefore
        be more efficient to build a query bottom-up instead of top-down. Here's a top-down
        example:</para>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-29.txt"/>
      <para>This query walks through a set of sections and queries each of them for paragraphs
        containing the string "XML". It then outputs the title of the section, followed by the
        matching paragraphs. Note that it will also return the title of all sections which do not
        have any matches.</para>
      <para>The nested <code>for</code> loop forces the query engine into a step-by-step iteration
        over the section elements. We can avoid this by using a bottom-up approach:</para>

      <para>The function <code>fn:matches</code> returns <code>true</code> if a substring of its

      <para>eXist-db automatically indexes all <code>xml:id</code> attributes and other attributes

        index is used by the standard <code>id</code> functions and provides a fast way to look up
        an element. For example, <code>id("sect1")/head</code> works through a fast index
        lookup.</para>

      <title>Defer output generation until really needed</title>

      <para>When working with large result sets within a query, it is important to understand the
          <emphasis>differences between stored nodes and in-memory XML</emphasis>: if a node set
        consists of nodes stored in the database, eXist-db will, in most cases, never load these
        into memory. It uses lightweight references instead for most processing steps. Even large
        node sets do not consume too much memory.</para>
      <para>However, all new XML nodes created within an XQuery reside in memory. The constructed
        XML fragments need to fit into the memory available to the Java VM. If a query generates too
        many nodes, the XQuery watchdog (if enabled) may step in and kill it.</para>
      <para>A typical scenario: a query selects a large number of documents from the database and
        then iterates through each to generate some HTML output for display. However, only the first
        10 results are returned to the user, the rest is stored into an HTTP session for later
        viewing. In this case it is important to limit the HTML generation to <emphasis>those items
          which are actually returned</emphasis>. Though the source XML documents may be large,
        eXist-db will not load them into memory. Storing those references into a session does not
        consume much memory:</para>

      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-34.txt"/>
      <para>Also note that eXist-db uses <emphasis>lazy evaluation</emphasis> when constructing new
        XML fragments. For example:</para>
      <programlisting language="xquery">&lt;book&gt;{$node/title}&lt;/book&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>Assuming that <code>$node</code> references a node in the database, the query engine
        will not copy <code>$node/title</code> into the constructed <tag>book</tag> element. Only a
        reference is inserted. The reference will not be expanded until the fragment is serialized
        or queried.</para>
