      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>This article describes strategies for improving the performance of eXist-db and
                optimizing its efficiency. It covers the a range of areas that can constrain
                performance, from memory and cache settings to the way a query is constructed. Many
                users of eXist-db have little reason to read this document until they encounter a query
                or operation that is performing poorly. However, whether you have reached that point
                or you are just curious about learning strategies for keeping your database and
                queries performing at peak efficiency, this is an essential document.</para>

      <title>Memory settings</title>

      <para>Java always limits the maximum amount of memory available to a process. eXist-db will
                thus not automatically use all of the memory available on your machine. The default
                setting is 1024MB.</para>
      <para>The maximum amount of memory Java will allocate is determined by the
                    <literal>-Xmx</literal> parameter passed to Java on the command line. When eXist-db is started
                    via the graphical launcher, parameters will be read from the file <literal>vm.properties</literal>.</para>
      <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="listings/listing-1.txt"/>
      <para>If you
                launch eXist via one of the shell or batch scripts, you need to change
                    <literal>-Xmx</literal> in there.</para>
      <para>On a <emphasis>Unix</emphasis> system, edit <literal>EXIST_HOME/bin/functions.d/eXist-settings.sh</literal>. Search for the
                    <literal>JAVA_OPTIONS</literal> variable, which sets <literal>-Xmx</literal> for the
                server. The <literal>CLIENT_JAVA_OPTIONS</literal> variable does the same for the Java
                admin client. Instead of directly editing <literal>eXist-settings.sh</literal>,
                you may also override those variables globally in your own shell.</para>
      <para>On <emphasis>Windows</emphasis>, the <literal>-Xmx</literal> settings is done in the
                main .bat files, .e.g. <literal>EXIST_HOME\bin\startup.bat</literal>.</para>
      <para>If you launch <emphasis>eXist-db as a service</emphasis>, all Java settings will be
                controlled by the service wrapper. In this case, the file to edit is <literal>EXIST_HOME/tools/yajsw/conf/wrapper.conf</literal>. The installer sets the memory you chose at install time (NNNN), but if you want to change it afterwards search for one of the following lines:</para>

   <sect1>
      <title>Cache settings</title>

      <para>Each of the core database files and indexes has a page cache. The main purpose of
                this cache is to make sure that the most frequently used pages of the db files are
                kept in memory. If a file's cache becomes too small, eXist may start to unload pages
                just to reload them a few moment later. This "trashing effect" results in an
                immediate performance drop, in particular while indexing documents.</para>
      <para>All caches share a single memory pool, whose size is determined by the attribute
                    <literal>cacheSize</literal> in the <tag>db-connection</tag> section of
                    <literal>conf.xml</literal>. The global cache manager will dynamically grant
                more memory to caches while they are under load and free the memory used by idle
                caches.</para>
      <example>
         <title>cacheSize parameter in conf.xml</title>
         <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-3.txt"/>
      </example>
      <para>The default setting for <literal>cacheSize</literal> is very conservative (48M). It
                will be OK for smaller databases, but you may soon experience a performance drop
                when indexing more than several 100M of XML data. Consider increasing
                    <literal>cacheSize</literal> up to approx. 1/3 of the main memory available to
                Java (determined by the <literal>-Xmx</literal> parameter passed to the Java command
                line). If you are running eXist-db with other web applications in the same servlet
                engine, you may need to choose a smaller setting (running out of memory will crash
                the database, so please be careful).</para>
      <para>The <literal>cacheSize</literal> is mainly relevant when storing/updating data. The
                effect on query speed should not be that big, unless some of the index caches are
                really much too small.</para>
      <para>If you continue to experience performance issues while storing data, you may need
                to revisit your index configuration. Removing unused indexes will give more room to
                the other indexes. In particular, the full text index can grow very fast until it
                becomes a bottleneck. Try to disable the default full text index (see below).</para>
      <para>The <literal>nodesBuffer</literal> attribute can be used to set eXist-db's temporary
                internal buffer to a fixed size. The buffer is used during indexing to cache nodes
                before they are flushed to disk. The default setting (nodesBuffer="-1") is to use as
                much memory as is available, but this can be problematic if you have to store large
                documents in a multi-user environment. For a production server, a good
                recommendation would be to set nodesBuffer to 1000 or less if there are many
                concurrent write operations.</para>

         <para>eXist-db does <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> index any element or attribute values by

         <programlisting>//SPEECH[SPEAKER = "HAMLET"]</programlisting>
         <para>the query engine will fall back to a full scan over all
                        <tag>SPEAKER</tag> elements in the db. This is very slow and limits
                    concurrency. You should at least create a global index definition (in <literal>/db/system/config/db/collection.xconf</literal>) and add range indexes for
                    the most frequently used comparisons.</para>

                    create a full text index on <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> elements and attributes in

                    makes it easier for the query optimizer to resolve dependencies. In particular,
                    avoid context-dependant index definitions unless you really have a reason to use
                    them. A context-dependant index is defined on a path like
                        <code>/book/chapter/title</code>, while general indexes are defined on a
                    simple element or attribute qname:</para>

         <para>Defining indexes on qnames may result in a larger index, but it also allows
                    the query engine to apply all available optimization techniques, which can

         <para>eXist-db uses indexes to directly locate an element or attribute by its name. It

         <para>If you need multiple steps to select certain nodes from a larger node set, try
                    to process the most selective steps first. The earlier you can reduce the node

         <programlisting language="xquery">/dblp/*[year &gt; 2000][author = 'Bjarne Stroustrup']</programlisting>
         <para>The database has 568824 records matching <code>year &gt; 2000</code>, but only
                    41 of them were written by Stroustrup. Moving the filter on the author to the

         <para>It would certainly be nice if eXist-db could do this kind of optimization

         <title>Avoid unnecessary nested filters</title>

         <para>Nesting filters in an XPath expression is often required and eXist-db will
                    process them correctly. However, unnecessary nesting should be avoided and has a
                    negative impact on the query optimizer. For example:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A[B[C = "D"]]</programlisting>
         <para>could also be written as</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A[B/C = "D"]</programlisting>
         <para>without changing the result. The variant with only one filter is easier to
                    optimize for eXist-db, whereas the nested filter implies a performance
                    penalty.</para>
         <para>Likewise, if you are calling one of the optimized functions (contains,
                    matches, ft:query ...), make sure you do not nest them unless really
                    required:</para>

         <title>Allow eXist-db to process large node sets in one step</title>

         <para>The query engine is optimized to process a path expression in one, single
                    operation. For instance, the XPath:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[B = 'C']</programlisting>
         <para>is evaluated in a single operation for all context items. It doesn't make a
                    difference if the input set comes from a single large document, includes all the
                    documents in a specific collection or even the entire database. The logic of the
                    operation remains the same.</para>
         <para>However, "bad" queries can force the query engine to partition the input
                    sequence and process it in an item-by-item mode. Several examples for bad uses
                    of FLWOR expressions will be given below. They should be easy to understand, but
                    other cases are not so obvious. For example, most function calls will also force
                    the query engine into item-by-item mode:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[f:process(B) = 'C']</programlisting>
         <para>The function has to be called once for every instance of B. Normally, eXist-db
                    would try to evaluate the general comparison in a single step (assuming there's
                    a usable index on B). However, it now needs to call a (non-optimized) function
                    for each B and will thus need to process the entire comparison once for every
                    context item.</para>
         <para>There are functions to which the above does not apply. This includes most
                    functions which operate on indexes, e.g. <code>contains</code>,
                        <code>matches</code>, <code>starts-with</code>, <code>ngram:contains</code>,
                    and the like. They are optimized so eXist-db only needs to call them once to
                    process the entire context set. For example, using <code>ngram:contains</code>
                    as below is perfectly OK:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[ngram:contains(B, 'C')]</programlisting>
         <para>while</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//A/*[ngram:contains(f:process(B), 'C')]</programlisting>
         <para>will again force eXist-db into step-by-step evaluation.</para>

         <title>Prefer XPath predicates over where expressions</title>

         <para>This is a variation of the problems discussed above. Many users tend to
                    formulate SQL-style queries using an explicit "where" clause:</para>

         <para>This could be rewritten as:</para>

            <title>Equivalent query using XPath predicate</title>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-22.txt"/>
         </example>
         <para>The "for … where" expression forces the query engine into a step-by-step
                    iteration over the input sequence, testing each instance of $e against the where
                    expression. Possible optimizations are lost.</para>
         <para>Contrary to this, the XPath predicate expression can be processed in one
                    single step, making best use of any available indexes. Sure, there are use cases
                    which cannot be handled without using "where", e.g. joins between multiple
                    documents, but you shouldn't use "where" if you can replace it
                    by a simple XPath.</para>
         <para>Internally, the query engine will always try to process a "where" clause like
                    an equivalent XPath with predicate. However, it only detects the simple
                    cases.</para>

         <title>Use general comparisons to compare an item to a list of alternatives</title>

         <para>General comparisons are very handy if you need to compare a given item to
                    several alternative values. For example, you could use an "or" to find all
                        <tag>b</tag> children whose string value is either "c" or
                    "d".</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//a[b eq 'c' or b eq 'd']</programlisting>
         <para>A shorter way to express this is:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">//a[b = ('c', 'd')]</programlisting>
         <para>The comparison will be true if b's string value matches one of the strings in
                    the right hand sequence. If an index is defined on <tag>b</tag>, eXist-db
                    will need only one index lookup to find all b's matching the comparison. The
                    equivalent "or" expression needs two separate index lookups.</para>

         <para>The XQuery 3.0 group by feature is much more efficient than using e.g.

         <para>If you need to query multiple collections which are on the same level of the
                    collection hierarchy, you could use a for loop to iterate over the collection
                    paths. However, this forces the query engine to process the remaining expression
                    once for each collection. It is thus better to construct the initial node set
                    once and use it as input for the main expression. For example:</para>

         <para>eXist-db can navigate the ancestor axis as fast as the descendant axis. It can
                    thus be more efficient to build a query bottom-up instead of top-down. Here's a
                    top-down example:</para>
         <example>
            <title>Top-down query using nested for</title>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-29.txt"/>
         </example>
         <para>This query walks through a set of sections and queries each of them for
                    paragraphs containing the string "XML". It then outputs the title of the
                    section, followed by the matching paragraphs. Note that it will also return the
                    title of all sections which do not have any matches.</para>
         <para>The nested for loop again forces the query engine into a step-by-step
                    iteration over the section elements. We can avoid this by using a bottom-up

         <para>eXist-db automatically indexes all xml:id attributes and other attributes with

                    index is used by the standard id functions and provides a fast way to look up an

         <title>Defer output generation until really needed</title>

         <para>When working with large result sets within a query, it is important to
                    understand the <emphasis>differences between stored nodes and in-memory
                        XML</emphasis>: if a node set consists of nodes which are stored in the
                    database, eXist-db will usually never load those nodes into memory. Instead, it
                    uses lightweight references for most processing steps. This way, even large node
                    sets do not consume too much memory.</para>
         <para>However, all new XML nodes created within an XQuery will reside in memory and
                    you should be aware that the constructed XML fragments need to fit into the
                    memory available to the Java VM. If a query generates too many nodes, the XQuery
                    watchdog (if enabled) may step in and kill it.</para>
         <para>A typical scenario: a query selects a large number of documents from the
                    database and then iterates through each to generate some HTML output for
                    display. However, only the first 10 results are really returned to the user, the
                    rest is stored into an HTTP session for later viewing.</para>
         <para>In this case it is important to limit the HTML generation to those items which
                    are actually returned. Though the source XML documents may be large, eXist-db will
                    not load them into memory, but just keep references to them. Storing those
                    references into a session does not consume much memory.</para>
         <example>
            <title>Limiting output generation</title>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-34.txt"/>
         </example>
         <para>Please note also that eXist-db uses <emphasis>lazy evaluation</emphasis> when
                    constructing new XML fragments. For example:</para>
         <programlisting language="xquery">&lt;book&gt;{$node/title}&lt;/book&gt;</programlisting>
         <para>Assuming that $node references a node in the database, the query engine will
                    not copy $node/title into the constructed <tag>book</tag> element.
                    Instead, only a reference is inserted. The reference will not be expanded until
                    the fragment is serialized or queried. So if you only need to wrap selected
                    parts of an element into a new fragment, memory consumption will not be too
                    high.</para>
