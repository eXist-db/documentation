        <title>Key Points to Learning XQuery</title>

        <para>This is a guide to help you learn XQuery. It contains some brief background
            information on XQuery and then lists a number of resources you can use to learn
            it.</para>
        <para>XQuery is unique in the development stack: It replaces both SQL and the traditional
            software layers that convert SQL into presentation formats such as HTML, PDF and ePub.
            XQuery can both retrieve information from your database and format it for presentation. </para>
        <para>Learning how to select basic data from an XML document can be accomplished in just a few
            hours, especially if you are already familiar with SQL and other functional programming
            languages. Learning how to create custom XQuery functions, how to design XQuery modules,
            and how to execute unit tests on XQuery takes considerably longer.</para>

            <title>Learning by Example</title>

            <para>Many people find that they learn a new language best by reading and trying small
                examples of code. One of the ideal locations for this is the <link condition="_blank" xlink:href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery#Beginning_Examples">XQuery Wikibook
                Beginning Examples</link>. These examples are all designed and tested to work with
                eXist. Please let us know if there are specific examples you would like to
                see.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="learning-functional">
            <title>Learning Functional Programming</title>

            <para>XQuery is a functional programming language, so many things that you do in
                procedural programs are not recommended or not possible. In XQuery all variables
                should be immutable, meaning they should be set once and never changed. This aspect
                of XQuery allows it to be stateless and side-effect free.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="learning-flwor">
            <title>Learning FLWOR statements</title>

            <para>Iteration in XQuery uses parallel programming statements called FLWOR (For, Let,
                Where, Order by, Return). Each loop of a FLWOR statement is performed in a separate
                thread of execution. As a result you cannot use the output of any computation in a
                FLWOR loop as input for the next iteration. This concept can be difficult to learn
                if you have never used parallel programming systems.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="learning-xpath">
            <title>Learning XPath</title>

            <para>XQuery includes the use of XPath to select various nodes from an XML document. In
                native XML databases (and eXist is no exception) the shortest XPath expression is
                often the fastest since short expressions use element indexes. You can use a tool
                such as an XPath "builder" tool within an IDE such as oXygen to learn how to build
                XPath expressions.</para>

            <para>eXist comes with a web-based tool for XQuery development called <link xlink:href="{eXide}/index.html">eXide</link>. Although this tool is not as advanced
                as a full IDE such as oXygen, it is ideal for small queries if an IDE is not
                accessible.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="debug-xq">
            <title>Learning how to debug XQuery</title>

            <para> Many people choose to debug complex recursive functions directly within XML IDEs
                such as oXygen that support step-by-step debugging, using the internal Saxon XQuery
                library. The oXygen IDE allows you to set breakpoints and watch the output document
                get created one element at a time. This process is strongly recommended if you are
                learning topics like recursion. </para>

        <sect2 xml:id="recursion-xq">
            <title>Learning recursion in XQuery</title>

            <para>XML is an inherently recursive data structure: trees contain sub-trees. Therefore
                many XQuery functions for transforming documents are best designed using recursion.
                A good place to start learning recursion is the identity node filter functions in
                the <link condition="_blank" xlink:href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/XQuery">XQuery
                Wikibook</link>.</para>
        </sect2>

        <!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->

        <sect2 xml:id="ide">
            <title>Effective use of your IDE</title>

            <para>Most developers who do XQuery more than a few hours a day eventually end up using
                a full commercial XQuery IDE, with oXygen being the best integrated with eXist. See
                <link xlink:href="oxygen">Using oXygen</link>. </para>
            <para> An important feature is the XQuery auto-complete. As you type within XQuery, all
                eXist functions and their parameters are listed. For example if you type
                <code>xmldb:</code>, all the functions of the XMLDB module will automatically appear
                in a drop-down list. As you continue to type or select a function the parameters and
                types are also shown. This becomes an important time-saver!</para>
