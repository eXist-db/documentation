      <para>Being much more than just an XML database, eXist-db provides a complete platform for the development of rich web applications based on XML
        and related technologies (XQuery, XForms, XSLT, XHTML...).</para>
      <para>Key components of this platform are:</para>

      <para>This tutorial will demonstrate how to quickly prototype an application based on above components. Certainly there are many other ways to
        integrate eXist-db into your own application. This guide describes only one of the many possible approaches. However, we have found that
        taking the first steps is the most difficult part for new users, so we tried to make it as simple as possible.</para>

      <title>The Packaging</title>

      <para>eXist-db builds on the concept of self-contained, modular applications which can be deployed into any database instance using a
        standardized packaging format. Applications live inside the database, so application code, HTML views, associated services and data all reside
        in the same place - though maybe in different root collections. This makes it easy to e.g. backup an application into the file system, pass it
        to someone else for installation in his own db, or even publish it to eXist-db's public repository. The documentation, the dashboard, eXide
        and the eXist XQuery Features Demo are examples of application packages.</para>
      <para>The packaging format is compliant with the EXPath packaging proposal, though it extends it considerably. For distribution, an application
        is packed into a .xar archive, which is basically a ZIP archive. The .xar archive contains all the application code required by the
        application, and optionally sample or full data, along with a set of descriptors. The descriptors describe the application and control the
        installation process. As an absolute minimum, an application package <emphasis>must</emphasis> contain two descriptor files:
          <literal>expath-pkg.xml</literal> and <literal>repo.xml</literal>. You can read more about those files in the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="repo.xml">package repository documentation</link>, but knowledge about these is not required for the following sections, since eXide will create the
        proper descriptors for you automatically.</para>

      <title>Starting a New Application</title>

      <para>To start a new application, open <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="{eXide}/index.html">eXide</link> by clicking the link or by going via the dashboard or the
        system tray menu of eXist-db.</para>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>From the main menu, select <literal>Application</literal>/<literal>New Application</literal>. The Deployment Editor
            dialog should pop up. If you are not logged in as an admin user yet, you'll first be required to do so.</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Fill out the form by choosing a template, a target collection, a name, an abbreviation and a title for the application. All other form
            fields and pages are optional, so you can ignore them for now.</para>

                     <para>The template used to generate the new application. Right now three templates are available: the "eXist-db Design" template is
                  based on the standard eXist-db page layout and design. The "Plain" template creates a basic page layout without eXist-db specific
                  stuff. Both templates use the Bootstrap CSS library for styling and the HTML templating XQuery module to achieve a clean separation
                  of concerns. The "Empty Package" creates an empty package with just the descriptors in it.</para>

                  template.</para>

                  for the name of the collection into which the application installs. It is thus best to choose a simple abbreviation without spaces
                  or punctuation characters.</para>

      <title>Understanding the Default Application Structure</title>

      <para>As you can see, eXide has created an application skeleton for you which works out of the box. All resources of the application reside
        below the target collection (<literal>/db/tutorial</literal>).</para>
      <para>The generated collection hierarchy follows a certain structure, which is usually the same for all apps which ship with eXist-db. The most
        important collections and files are described below:</para>
      <variablelist spacing="compact">
         <varlistentry>
            <term>/modules/</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>Contains XQuery modules. Most of the actual application code should go here.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>/resources/</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>Secondary resources like CSS files, images or JavaScript.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>/templates/</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>Page templates containing all the repeating parts of the site's HTML layout, i.e. all the stuff which applies to every HTML view of
              the application.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>collection.xconf</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>A template file for the index configuration that should apply to this application. This file will be copied into the correct system
              collection when the application is installed, thereby automatically indexing any data that is installed.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>controller.xql</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>The URL rewriting controller which handles the URL space of the application. You will rarely need to change this for simple
              applications.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>expath-pkg.xml and repo.xml</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>These are the package descriptor files for the application that contain the information you entered via the Deployment Editor. You
              don't need to edit these files directly. Instead, open the Deployment Editor to change any of the descriptor properties.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>index.html</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>The default start page of the application.</para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
         <varlistentry>
            <term>pre-install.xql</term>
            <listitem>
               <para>An XQuery script which will be run by the package manager <emphasis>before</emphasis> installing the app. By default, the script
              only ensures that the index configurations in collection.xconf are properly copied into the corresponding system collection before the
              app is installed.</para>
               <para>In addition to <literal>pre-install.xql</literal>, you may also define a <literal>post-install.xql</literal> script
              via the Deployment Editor. As the name says, this script will run after the app has been deployed into the database and is most often
              used to copy resources or run initialization tasks required by the app. </para>
            </listitem>
         </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      <para>You are not required to keep this structure. Feel free to restructure the app as you like it and remove some of its parts. However, you
        have to preserve the two descriptor files <literal>expath-pkg.xml</literal> and <literal>repo.xml</literal>.</para>

   <sect1>
      <title>The HTML Templating Framework </title>

      <para>The generated application code uses the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="templating.xml">HTML Templating Framework</link> to connect HTML views with the
        application logic. The goal of the HTML templating framework in eXist-db is a clean separation of concerns. Generating web pages directly in
        XQuery is quick and dirty, but this makes maintenance difficult and it is usually bad for code sharing and for team work. If you look at the
          <literal>index.html</literal> page, you'll see it is just an HTML div defining the actual content body. The rest of the page is dragged in
        from the page template residing in <literal>templates/page.html</literal>.</para>
      <para>The <literal>controller.xql</literal> is configured to call the HTML templating for every URL ending with <literal>.html</literal>. The
        processing flow for an arbitrary <literal>.html</literal> file is shown below:</para>
      <figure>
         <title>Processing Flow</title>
         <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
               <imagedata fileref="assets/Templating.png"/>
            </imageobject>
         </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>The input for the templating is always a plain HTML file. The module scans the HTML view for elements with class attributes, following a
        simple convention. It tries to translate the class attributes into XQuery function calls. By using class attributes, the HTML remains
        sufficiently clean and does not get messed up with application code. A web designer could take the HTML files and work on them without being
        bothered by the extra class names. </para>
      <para>If you look at <literal>index.html</literal>, the class attribute on the outer div contains a call to a templating function:</para>
      <programlisting language="html">&lt;div class="templates:surround?with=templates/page.html&amp;amp;at=content"&gt;</programlisting>
      <para>
        <code>templates:surround</code> is one of the default templating functions provided by the module. It loads
          <literal>templates/page.html</literal> and inserts the current div from <literal>index.html</literal> into the element with the id
        "content" in <literal>templates/page.html</literal>. A detailed description of <code>templates:surround</code> can be found in the HTML
        templating module documentation.</para>
      <para>In the generated application template, you can add your own templating functions to the XQuery module
        <literal>modules/app.xql</literal>, which is included by default (you can also add your own modules though: just import them in
          <literal>modules/view.xql</literal>). </para>
   </sect1>

      <title>Example: "Hello World!"</title>

      <para> For illustration, let's implement the traditional "Hello World!" example: </para>
      <orderedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>Create a new HTML view, <literal>hello.html</literal>, in eXide and add the following content. To create the file, choose
              <literal>File</literal> / <literal>New</literal> from the menu. Make sure you set the <literal>file type</literal> to HTML
            (see the drop down box at the top right in eXide).</para>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xml" xlink:href="listings/listing-2.txt"/>
            <para>This creates a simple form and a paragraph which is connected to a template function, <literal>app:helloworld</literal>, through its
            class attribute.</para>
            <para>Save the HTML view to the root collection of your application, e.g. <literal>/db/apps/tutorial/hello.html</literal>.</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Open <literal>modules/app.xql</literal> and add an XQuery function matching the <code>app:helloworld</code> template
            call:</para>
            <programlisting xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" language="xquery" xlink:href="listings/listing-3.txt"/>
            <para>A template function is a normal XQuery function known in the context of the calling XQuery (<literal>modules/view.xql</literal>),
            which takes at least two required parameters: $node and $model, though additional parameters are allowed (see below). $node is the HTML
            element currently being processed - in this case a <tag>p</tag> element. $model is an XQuery map containing application data. We
            can ignore both parameters for this simple example, but they must be present or the function won't be recognized by the templating module.
            Please refer to the <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="templating.xml">HTML templating documentation</link> to read more about those parameters.</para>
            <para>The third parameter, $name, is injected automatically by the templating framework. For now it is sufficient to know that the
            templating library will try to make a best guess about how to fill in any additional parameters. In this case, an HTTP request parameter
            with the name "name" will be passed in when the form is submitted. The parameter name matches the name of the variable, so the templating
            framework will try to use it and the function parameter will be set to the value of the request parameter. </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>Open <literal>hello.html</literal> in the web browser using the base URL of your app, e.g.:</para>
            <programlisting>http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/tutorial/hello.html</programlisting>
            <para>Fill out the box with a name and press return.</para>

      <title>Exporting the App</title>

      <para>Once you have created the first pages of an application, it is usually a good idea to export it to a folder on disk. You could just click
        on <literal>Application</literal>/<literal>Download app</literal> to retrieve a <literal>.xar</literal> archive of the
        application, but exporting the app to the file system has the advantage that you can continue working on the app and have eXide keep track of
        which files have been modified since the last export. You may also want to add your app to a source control system like subversion or git, and
        this is easier if you have a copy on the file system.</para>
      <para>To create an export to a directory on the file system, click
        <literal>Application</literal>/<literal>Synchronize</literal>. In the popup dialog, fill in the path to the desired
          <emphasis>Target directory</emphasis>. If you are accessing eXist-db on a server, not the machine you are opening eXide in, this must point
        to a directory on the server running eXist-db, not your local file system. If you are running eXist from your own machine, the two are the
        same. The <emphasis>Start time</emphasis> can be ignored for now. It may show the time of your last export if you call synchronize again on
        the same application.</para>

      <para>Those working on data sets in TEI may want to look into <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://teipublisher.com">TEI Publisher</link> instead of following
        the procedures described above. It includes an application generator tailored at digital editions. The created app packages already include
        all the basic functionality needed for browsing the edition, searching it or producing PDFs and ePUBs. </para>
