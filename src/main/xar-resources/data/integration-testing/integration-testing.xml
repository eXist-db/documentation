  <para>To ensure the long-term maintainability of an application, it is important to not only test its individual functions, but also the way the application interacts with other components of the exist-db environment. This artilce covers recommendations for configuring an automated test environment to perform integration test of eXist-db apps.</para>
  <para>These recommendations apply to application developers of any level. However, it also defines the minimal requirements for authors who wish to publish their apps under the exist-db namespace. It assumes that you are familiar with the <link xlink:href="xqsuite">XQsuite framework</link> for unit-testing.</para>
